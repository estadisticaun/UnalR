Despite our efforts, it was not possible to address or bypass the following issues:

While we are aware of the recommendation not to depend on more than 20 packages, our principle of innovation (*our package consolidates several libraries into a single function and allows for a very quick, easy, and friendly way to navigate the world of interactive and static graphics*) does not permit us to comply. It should be noted that we did attempt to minimize dependencies.

Although we know the recommendation not to exceed `5MB` (*we only exceeded by* `400kB`), it was not possible to reduce this because one of our sources (the one responsible for creating the maps) uses the official and updated polygons of Colombia, sourced directly from the National Administrative Department of Statistics - **DANE**, which is the entity responsible for the planning, collection, processing, analysis, and dissemination of official statistics in Colombia. And this is how it needs to be.

We hope for your understanding and support in publishing this package, which will have a significant impact on the management and publication of official statistics by the countryâ€™s leading university.

## CRAN package review response

Additional comments by reviewer:

+ **Solved**

Please make sure that you do not change the user's options, par or working directory. If you really have to do so within functions, please ensure with an *immediate* call of on.exit() that the settings are reset when the function is exited. e.g.: -> R/Plot_Radar.R

```
oldpar <- par(no.readonly = TRUE) # code line i
on.exit(par(oldpar))              # code line i + 1
```
```
par(mfrow=c(2,2))                 # somewhere after
```

+ **Solved** Please also add an english translation of your description in the DESCRIPTION file after the spanish version.
+ **Solved** Please omit "+ file LICENSE" and the file itself which is part of R anyway. It is only used to specify additional restrictions to the GPL such as attribution requirements.
